Welcome to django_dbdev's documentation!
========================================

**django_dbdev** is a set of Django management commands that makes it very easy work with database servers during development.

We provide Django management commands to:

- Setup a clean and isolated database environment in a temporary folder. This
  means that you do not have to touch ANY globally installed database configs or
  databases.
- Create and destroy this isolated database enviroment, including all those hard
  to remember commands to create the database, create a user with the correct
  privileges etc.
- Load database dumps.
- Backup and restore your database.


Supported databases
===================
- PostgreSQL
- Sqlite3
- MySQL
- MariaDB (same backend as MySQL)

You can also easily :doc:`add support for more databases <custom_backend>`.
